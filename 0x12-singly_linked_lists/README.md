**0x12. C - Singly linked lists**

#Advantages of Linked Lists
The size of linked lists is not fixed, they can expand and shrink during run time.
Insertion and Deletion Operations are fast and easier in Linked Lists.
Memory allocation is done during run-time (no need to allocate any fixed memory).
Data Structures like Stacks, Queues, and trees can be easily implemented using Linked list.

#Disadvantages of Linked Lists
Memory consumption is more in Linked Lists when compared to arrays.
Because each node contains a pointer in linked list and it requires extra memory.
Elements cannot be accessed at random in linked lists.
Traversing from reverse is not possible in singly linked lists.

#Applications of Linked Lists
Linked Lists can be used to implement Stacks, Queues and Trees.
Linked Lists can be also used to implement Graphs. (Adjacency list representation of Graph).
Linked Lists can be used to Implement Hash Tables 
- Each Bucket of the hash table can be a linked list (Open chain hashing).
