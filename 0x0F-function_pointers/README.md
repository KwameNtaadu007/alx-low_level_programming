**FUNCTION POINTERS**

Function pointers are variables that hold the memory address of a function. In other words, it is a pointer that points to the memory location of a function in the program. It allows the program to pass a reference to a function as an argument to another function, or store a function address in a data structure like an array or a struct.

To declare a function pointer, you need to use the function's return type, followed by an asterisk and the name of the pointer variable.

A function pointer holds the memory address of the function it points to. Specifically, it holds the address of the function's entry point, which is the memory location where the function begins executing.

The memory address where a function pointer points to in virtual memory depends on the operating system and the platform. Generally, the virtual memory address of a function is determined by the compiler, and it can vary from one execution to another, depending on the layout of the program in memory.
