**DEBUGING**
This project is geared towards building attitude of 
understanding how computers process our work so we 
know how to describe problems and find solutions in
the process. Essentially we are learning the concepts and 
processes of debugging manually.

Task 0 is to test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0

Task 1 is to figure out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Task 2 is to Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

Task 3 is fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
