## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various search algorithms in the C programming language. The search algorithms covered in this project include linear search and binary search. This README provides an explanation of these algorithms and when to use each based on specific needs.

## Search Algorithms

### 1. Linear Search

#### What is a Linear Search?
A linear search is a simple searching algorithm that traverses the elements sequentially to find a specific value in a list. It checks each element one by one until the desired element is found or until the end of the list is reached.

#### When to Use Linear Search?
- Suitable for small-sized lists or arrays.
- When the elements are not sorted.
- When the list doesnâ€™t have a predefined structure.

### 2. Binary Search

#### What is a Binary Search?
Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm compared to linear search. It operates on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It compares the target value with the middle element of the array and eliminates half of the remaining elements at each step.

#### When to Use Binary Search?
- Ideal for larger-sized sorted arrays or lists.
- When the elements are sorted in ascending or descending order.
- More efficient compared to linear search, especially for larger datasets.

## Choosing the Right Search Algorithm

### Factors to Consider:
- **Size of Data:** For smaller datasets, a linear search might suffice. Binary search is more efficient for larger datasets.
- **Data Structure:** Binary search requires the data to be sorted, while linear search does not have this requirement.
- **Time Complexity:** Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), whereas linear search has O(n) complexity.

Choose the appropriate search algorithm based on the specific requirements of the problem you are trying to solve.

## Usage

The C programs in this repository demonstrate the implementations of both linear and binary search algorithms. Each algorithm is provided in a separate C file along with comments for clarity.

### Running the Code
- Compile the C files using a C compiler (e.g., `gcc`) with the desired flags.
- Execute the compiled executable to test the search algorithms.
